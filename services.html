          <p>One-on-one training consists of guidance provided either in your own home or at a personal studio in your area. Thinking that you absolutely must go to a gym to have an effective workout is a common mistake that I want to help you avoid. Although many larger chain gyms may have more of the equipment that can help to maximize your workout, I can show you how to fully realize your fitness potential in an environment that is more comforting to you, whether it be a small studio down the street from you or your own living room.</p>

          I enjoy working with groups just as much as I do single individuals. Groups that I train range from 2 to 4 clients at a time and are trained in various areas. This is often a more affordable way to break into the fitness world not only because group rates do differ from individual rates, but also because familiar company takes away much of the intimidation of the gym while inspiring you to give that bit of extra effort.<br>
          If you have ten or more people, I will travel to your location and host a bootcamp style workout. This is often ideal for corporate group as well as sporting group events. These group bootcamps usually consist of 1-hour sessions and can be held at a local park, school, or even your workplace parking lot!

          <p>Just as I can tailor my workout instruction to the specific needs of young and elderly clients, my training can be geared toward clients recovering from an injury. Years of experience and professional training have allowed me to become more aware of the limits placed on the body by any range of injuries, both current and prior. My rehabilitation-geared training will help you get back on your feet without missing a step along the way.</p>

This combination of flexibility of knowledge and attention to an individual’s often changing needs opens the range of my clientele to include anyone who is interested in reaching their personal fitness goals. I have in the past and continue to work with clients including stay-at-home moms, obese children and men and women from age 10 to 75. If you have particular needs that may, in the past, have kept you from reaching for your fitness goals, let me help you get started on the right track.</p>

  <p>I carefully design a custom meal plan according to the workout plan being used and your personal fitness and nutritional needs. Each meal plan is personally customized on demand, rather than taken from a portfolio of pre-prescribed plans so you can be absolutely certain it is the right fit for you.</p>
